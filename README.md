Heroku-powered robot (1-DYNO) to see who wants to `go to collage`.


> Just told my mom I don't want to go to collage and she was like " are you huffing? Are you high?"  

> Girl go to collage to get more knowledge,boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider.

> I hate people who don't go to collage or somewhere to form a career.
